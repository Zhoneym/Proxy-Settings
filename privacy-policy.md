# Privacy Policy

This browser extension ("Proxy Settings") does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII).

## What Data We Collect
We do **not** collect or store any data from users. All data (such as proxy rules and settings) are stored **locally** on your device via browser storage APIs.

## Network Access
This extension may use proxy or network settings configured by the user to access websites, but it does not send any usage data externally.

## Permissions
The extension requires access to:
- `proxy`: to configure proxy settings
- `storage`: to save settings locally
- `tabs`: optional, only if required by future features

These permissions are used strictly for the functionality of the extension. No data is transmitted to any external server.

## Contact
If you have any questions or concerns about privacy, feel free to contact the developer via GitHub: [Zhoneym](https://github.com/Zhoneym)
